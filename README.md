# simple-atm-system

Feel free to use this as a reference, or to optimize it.

I made this project just for fun.

The configuration like a dummy blalance or dummy pincode can be found in the hidden package.

I am planning to fetch this from a databse in the future. But feel free to use this as the basic how to create a atm system.
